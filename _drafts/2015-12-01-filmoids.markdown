description: Filmoids is a desktop video system; which has been developed for the Macintosh. It maps digital film clips to a psuedo genome and then 'breeds' them together to create offspring. **Filmoids** explores an alternative method of engaging the computer in digital filmmaking, which has evolved as a distinctive art form with its own rules and language - very different from its analog video and film predecessors. **Filmoids** uses the metaphor of digital films being something organic, a form grown in the computer space. The digital film forms have an underlying artificial life algorithm, fluid and autonomous, a kind of "control without control". In this model the digital film is self-directed, and the filmmaking hierarchy of director, producer, editor do not exist. This system acts as a commentary on filmmaking and its inherent notions of narrative and directorial authorship.
