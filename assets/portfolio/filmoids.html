<h2>Filmoids</h2>

<h3>Role: Conceptual Design / Interface Design</h3>

<h4>Client: Personal Project</h4>

<p><strong>Filmoids</strong> is a desktop video system; which has been developed for the Macintosh. It maps digital film clips to a psuedo genome and then &#39;breeds&#39; them together to create offspring.</p>

<p><strong>Filmoids</strong> explores an alternative method of engaging the computer in digital filmmaking, which has evolved as a distinctive art form with its own rules and language - very different from its analog video and film predecessors.</p>

<p><strong>Filmoids</strong> uses the metaphor of digital films being something organic, a form grown in the computer space. The digital film forms have an underlying artificial life algorithm, fluid and autonomous, a kind of &quot;control without control&quot;. In this model the digital film is self-directed, and the filmmaking hierarchy of director, producer, editor do not exist. This system acts as a commentary on filmmaking and its inherent notions of narrative and directorial authorship.</p>
