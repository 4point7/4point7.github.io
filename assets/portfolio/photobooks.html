<p>Snapfish Photo Books
Role: Lead UX Designer, 22 markets worldwide
Client: Snapfish by HP</p>

<p>Snapfish is a digital photo and e-commerce company. This was a re-design of the photo book category for Europe and Asia Pacific, focusing on the &#39;consideration&#39; part of the purchase flow. Customers had to be able to understand all the different book templates on offer, easily compare them and then make a selection. Creating a photo book is a time investment so it is critical the customer makes the correct selection at this point in the flow. During user testing we found that our test participants used different criteria for selection. Some chose by book size, others by the number of photos the book held and others by price. Our design had to acommodate all these behaviours.</p>

<p>The book product inventory is also differed between countries, so the design had to be scalable and offer easy access to an offline book building application which some customers were using.</p>

<p>Due to client confidentiality, a case study of this project is only available on request.</p>
