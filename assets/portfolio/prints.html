<h3>Role: Lead UX Designer, 22 markets worldwide</h3>

<h4>Client: Snapfish by HP</h4>

<p>Snapfish is a digital photo and e-commerce company. Photo prints are still big sellers and on average 60% of customers order more than 40 prints.</p>

<p>People are also taking more digital images, so issues like cropping which occurs when a customer prints a digital (3.4) image on a classic (2.3) print size needed a solution.</p>

<p>An application was needed which allowed users to be able to create, edit and review large quantities of prints before entering the checkout flow.</p>

<p>Due to client confidentiality, a case study of this project is only available on request.</p>
