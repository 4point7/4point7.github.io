   text: During the discovery phase I analyzed the web traffic in the primary markets, collected feedback from the customer service team worldwide and researched the current best practices for checkout flows. This gave the project team a full understanding of the customers' pain points and where they were dropping off.

   caption: Cart and billing/shipping re-designed
   alt:
   text: Some of the more low risk design changes were made to the checkout flow and I did two rounds of usability testing so the team could understand what items to add to the backlog. A primary finding across all markets was that the total price needed to be displayed upfront on the cart page and not for the first time on the review page. This meant any coupons or offers, shipping options or deleted products needed to immediately be reflected in the total price. The first phase of the re-design brought all the redemption flows onto the cart page the success of which was measured by running an A/B test. A second design phase integrated the shipping options flow which was again measured by A/B testing. At the end of the second phase a final round of usability testing was completed so the design changes could be verified in the context of the full checkout flow.
