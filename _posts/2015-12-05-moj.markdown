intro: Government Digital Service (GDS) in the UK has the job of digitally transforming government, to achieve this it operates more like a tech start up than a government organization. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ)  is a government department which is focused on creating a digitally enabled criminal justice service. The challenge was to design a new digital channel for the submission and management of advocates bills for defense costs in the Crown Court. The system currently being used for submitting these claims is the accumulation of years of task specific processes on top of processes which all have numerous supporting forms and protocols. The aim of this project was to start with user needs and apply service design thinking to simplify the end-to-end system and  allow legal professionals and internal government employees to respectively submit and process claims. Around 150,000 claims are processed per year and these range from a dozen pages of paper to those with thousand of pages.

    text: As the lead researcher on this project I was embedded in a multi-disciplinary agile team and designed and executed the research plan from the discovery phase through to the beta launch. “User research is a team sport”  is the motto of  GDS  and part of the role of the researchers is to facilitate this throughout the project cycle and to come up with techniques and methods to keep other team members continually engaged with users. During discovery we mapped out the end to end service and used a number of different sources of insight to identify user needs and develop an understanding of the the spectrum of the service’s users. The new submission system includes an application  ‘Advocate Defence Payments’, at the beginning of the alpha phase the designer on the team prototyped some initial concepts for each user story. I used these for concept testing and as a stimulus to get a deeper understanding of the user needs. The prototype was iterated upon using build/measure/learn cycles throughout beta until it was at a point where users could begin to process claims and be paid via the system.

    caption: Usability testing
    text: A digital channel has been designed which addresses the primary user needs of both legal professionals and government employees, it allows legal providers to be paid quickly and run their businesses more efficiently.  Legal professionals can directly submit their claims from their case management system to the government processing centre. Claims will be queued and allocated via a custom built tool which will considerably reduce the hours currently involved in allocating claims to government employees. Another key issue which we solved was reducing the number of rejected claims, this was tackled first at the process level and secondly via a communication tool which will allow a number of items to be resolved directly between the provider and government caseworker before a decision is taken on the claim.
