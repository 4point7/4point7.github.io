   text: User testing highlighted to us that the difference in print sizes between digital and film photo formats is an unfamiliar and confusing topic. So we designed the application to  automatically select the correct print size for the photos which the customer has uploaded. We also mapped the customers mental model and adapted the print purchase flow to follow a "select > act > proof > buy” behavior pattern.
