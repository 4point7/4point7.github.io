intro: Snapfish is a digital photo and e-commerce company. Photo prints are amongst the biggest sellers with 60% of customers ordering more than 40 prints.

   text: The challenge was to create an application which allowed customers to organize, edit and review large quantities of prints before entering the checkout flow. Customers often received different sizes of prints within an order or found that thier photos had been cropped. This is partly due to the increase in people taking more digital photographs with varying aspect ratios from 3.4 to 1.1 and these ratios not being equivalent to print sizes.

   text: I evaluated the existing print flow in the USA, Europe and Asia and then analyzed the corresponding web analytics. In tandem with this I interviewed customer service and business stakeholders. I synthesized these findings into a low-fidelity axure prototype which was used by the engineering team to create a high-fidelity prototype for user testing. This prototype allowed test participants to use their own Snapfish accounts and photographs. Remote moderated testing was carried out in Ireland with six participants over two days.

   text: A key finding from the user testing was that the difference in print ratios between digital and film photo formats is an unfamiliar and confusing topic hence the test participants were unclear about the repurcussions of the choices they were being asked to make around aspect ratio. The application was designed to automatically detect the correct print size for the customers photos.Customers now make choices based on whether their photos are to be put in a photo album or hung on the wall, rather than trying to understand what aspect ratio thier source photo is. We also mapped the customers mental model of purchasing prints and aligned the purchase flow to match their behavior pattern of "select > act > proof > buy”.
