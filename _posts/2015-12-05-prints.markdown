   text: A key finding from the user testing was that the difference in print ratios between digital and film photo formats is an unfamiliar and confusing topic. So we designed the application to automatically select the correct print size for the photos uploaded , the application does the thinking for the customer. We also mapped the customers mental model of purchasing prints and aligned the purchase flow to match their behavior pattern of "select > act > proof > buy‚Äù.
