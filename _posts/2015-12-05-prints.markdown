   text: User testing showed us that print formats are an unfamiliar and confusing topic. We designed the application so that it automatically selects the correct print format for the photos which the customer has uploaded. We also mapped the customers mental model and adapted the flow to follow a select > act > proof > buy behavior pattern.
