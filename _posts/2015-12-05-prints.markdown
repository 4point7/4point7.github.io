intro: Snapfish is a digital photo and e-commerce company.
description: Photo prints are still big sellers and on average 60% of customers order more than 40 prints. People are also taking more digital images, so issues like cropping which occurs when a customer prints a digital (3.4) image on a classic (2.3) print size needed a solution. An application was needed which allowed users to be able to create, edit and review large quantities of prints before entering the checkout flow. Due to client confidentiality, a case study of this project is only available on request.
